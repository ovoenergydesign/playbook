# Why we ask for consent when conducting user research at OVO

## What is ‘Informed Consent’?
At OVO we strive to be ‘The Good Guys’, this means being open, honest and transparent when talking with our customers and doing no harm to them. 

When we are conducting research we achieve this by asking for the participants ‘informed consent’. This is a process by which a participant confirms that they understand all the aspects of the research and agree to take part. We keep a record of this decision.

GDPR also has an effect on how we ask for consent, as it introduces the mandate to provide participants with the choice for how their data is used.   

### Getting consent means ensuring the participant understands:
* who you are
* purpose of the research
* what they will be doing
* what happens with their information and data
* if the session is being observed or recorded in any way
* their participation is voluntary 
* they can withdraw their consent at anytime

## How we ask for consent
There is not a single perfect way of gaining consent from a participant, the act of doing so should be appropriate to the research method and adapted to the participants needs. 

This might mean that a record of consent is recorded verbally, digitally confirmed or signed on a piece of paper. 

### Gaining consent should follow these principles: 
* make sure participants understand it
* empower participants to customise their level of consent
* give participants time to digest the information

#### In practice for an in person depth interview or usability test this might look like:
1. Send the information sheet a few days before the research to the participant
2. On the day show the participants the same information sheet with an attached area to sign. This is now called the ‘Consent form’
3. Check they understand what the research is about and allow for questions
4. Remind them that their participation is voluntarily
5. If they’re happy to proceed ask them to indicate their level of consent
