# OVO Energy User Experience playbook
An experiment in capturing shared knowledge  
_We're still in early days, so excuse the mess around here..._


## What's this?
This repo contains the OVO Energy user experience playbook. It's intention is to detail what we do, how we work, and our agreed best practices and reusable artefacts. It'll be filled with the things we've learnt individually and as a team.

The concept is based on [Changing the laws of engineering with pull requests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIpNpptGX6Q).  
An example of one in the wild: [Springer Nature front-end playbook[(https://github.com/springernature/frontend-playbook).

This is a living document that we contribute to in a public GitHub repo. 
We want to work in the open and share our experiences as we experiment with this.
